# jDriveClonr

> A Java port of DriveClonrPro, with additional features and improvements.

New year, new project! Introducing jDriveClonr, the Java port of the original Python-based DriveClonrPro! This project is designed to be a more efficient and user-friendly alternative to the original DriveClonrPro, with a focus on performance and ease of use.

Immediately, before even implementing multithreading, jDriveClonr is already faster than the original DriveClonrPro! It also _finally_ supports the TreeView for selecting files and folders to clone, which was a long-awaited feature in the original DriveClonrPro. Additionally, jDriveClonr is designed to be more modular and extensible, making it easier to add new features and improvements in the future! 

## Features

- Multithreading support for faster cloning
- TreeView for selecting files and folders to clone
- ðŸ†• Google Photos Cloning Support! 
- ðŸ†• Lazy-loading for faster UI
- ðŸ†• Improved error handling and logging
- ðŸ†• JavaFX Native UI
- Pretty much everything else that was in DriveClonrPro, but better!
